Go2CO2 - open source carbonation system for professional brewers

## So what is this about?
Go2CO2 - reponame actually shortened to g2co2 to not confuse things with the programming language Go - is hardware and software combined to create a professional carbonation system (force carbonation) for breweries. The spirit of Go2CO2 is to provide a solution that can be built by brewers all over the world, thus as far as possible items that will be used are commonly available.

## Is it commercial?
Yes - When prototyping is done, units will be manufactured and sold. As time goes by, these may get more tailormade housings etc. but using same active components as provided in the github repo. A note about housing. This is probably one of the only parts that DIY makers will have to source themselves but most high IP rated housings should work (remember, these are operated in wet environment)

## The history of the device.
It all started in march 2017. I am part owner of a brewery (Brygghus 19) in Sweden and this year we arranged the second annual "Craftbeer Malmoe (Malm√∂) CBM" brewers' conference. Second annual means that we had done this before and both this year and past year we had invited Jamil Zainasheff as a speaker for the conference. So we sat there at the breakfast bouncing ideas for next year's conference and we kind of then and there decided that it would be "The art of carbonation". Jamil then told us about an idea that he was working with in his brewery (Heretic Brewing Company) where he was using an kompressor (air pump) to increase the pressure in a recirculating CO2 system with regulated CO2 injection pressure. This is what triggered my building thoughts to do a similar device but to make it quite automated. Kind of fire and forget as long as you have a steady temperature in your bright-ber tank.
